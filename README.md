# Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN

**Overview:**
This project focuses on implementing a Traffic Sign Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to detect and classify various types of traffic signs in images. It's a crucial component of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and contributes to road safety and driver convenience.


**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the main script for real-time traffic sign recognition.


**Dataset:**
The model was trained on a dataset of labeled traffic sign images, encompassing different sign types and environmental scenarios.
